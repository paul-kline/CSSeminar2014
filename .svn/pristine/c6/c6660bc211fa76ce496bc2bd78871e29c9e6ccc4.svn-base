3. Installation & Running
-------------------------

  This game requires a Java 1.1 compatible JVM in order to run. It 
  can be run directly from the tetris.jar file with this command:
  
    java -jar lib/tetris.jar

  It can also be embedded as an applet in a web page, with the 
  following HTML code:
  
    <applet archive="tetris.jar" code="net.percederberg.tetris.Main" 
            width="330" height="400" >
        Your browser does not support Java applets.
    </applet>

  Both the stand-alone and applet versions of the game support the
  a number of configuration parameters, either given as properties on
  the command-line (-Dname=value) or as an applet parameter
  (<param name="" value="">). All color values should be specified 
  with hexadecimal values for their red, green, and blue components, 
  in the format '#RRGGBB' (like '#ff8080' for example).
  
    tetris.color.background       - Game background color.
    tetris.color.label            - Text color of the labels.
    tetris.color.button           - Start and pause button bolor.
    tetris.color.board.background - Background game board color.
