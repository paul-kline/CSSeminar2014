1. Introduction
---------------

  This document contains a list of the currently known issues and 
  suggested improvements to the Java Tetris game. Please verify that 
  any new problem found is not in this list before sending a bug 
  report.



2. Known Issues
---------------

 o Under X Windows, the keyboard commands to move the figures do not 
   work after pressing the 'Start' button. This is caused by an error
   with the keyboard focus, and may be worked around by clicking once
   on the game board. Any working solutions to this problem, would be
   appreciated.



3. Suggested Improvements
-------------------------

 o When lines are removed some Tetris games allow the squares above 
   to fall down until they land again. Implementing this would 
   probably require some animation when moving the squares.

 o An automatic play mode (screen saver mode) could be written that 
   plays the game by itself after a certain period of inactivity.
